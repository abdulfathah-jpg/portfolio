For long, Western philosophical tradition grappled with a daunting dilemma between nurture and nature: are our abilities and traits determined primarily by our biological nature or by the environments that raise and shape us? The two positions — tracing their authoritative roots to Plato’s Eternal Forms and Aristotle’s Tabula Rasa respectively — seem to have arrived at a settlement in the late twentieth century: both forces are not competing, but co-acting and intertwined in the human psyche. For now, my readers might be a bit baffled at introducing this now antiquated debate to a blog about the world’s most awe-inspiring invention: Machine Learning. Well, I think few philosophical analogies illuminate this technological stage more vividly! Are Artificial Intelligence systems themselves the product of a pre-trained architecture or ‘nurture’ – exposure to vast amounts of data around? That OCR recognition abilities employed in our study of manuscripts may be understood to fall solely into the second set of abilities explains both its advantages and its distinctive place from a whole lot of other intelligence, for instance, that of a digital ‘humanist’ behind the screen.

To many, the learning process of OCR models resembles that of an archetypal child in a language class – imitating teachers and gradually discerning the acceptable variations of a letter or sound, except that Machine Learning represents both compressed time and space when compared to a human lifetime. In that it is more of a continuously ‘supervised’ learning at play here, we might as well want to rethink conventional ways of interacting with computers. Think of a student using a conventional translation app that is pre-programmed on certain datasets and dictionaries; he has a static accuracy expectation from the app that helps when editing the computer output. However, a digital humanist working on e-scriptorium cannot expect his models to behave in a uniform manner all the time, and the dynamic learning environment and ‘nurture’ from successive corrections bear on the model to produce different results, thereby wanting him to interact dynamically with the computer. Do Machine Learning technologies offer anything more than mere speed and accuracy meant to replace the older, more ‘exhaustive’ human classification and standardization attempts (not that this particular job, as in the case of OCR, is anything less worthy!)?

Recognizing that we are still far from realizing these, and that a digital humanist as an academic might as well be more reserved to adopt them, we may still list some prospects:

*	discovering non-obvious patterns using detection of regularities and embedding models, for instance, unsupervised clustering of scribal hands that reveal unexpected regional or guild networks

*	multimodal reading of manuscripts, for instance, discovering how marginalia visually comment on main text themes

* diffusion or transformer-based generative models could predict missing text or reconstruct fragmentary codices, and finally and more controversially

* a reflexive work revealing scholarly biases and moving beyond limitations of human collaborations.

It is in these emerging fields that we might witness the paramount consequences of resolving the age-old philosophical debate of nature versus nurture.
