We are pleased to announce the completion of Mini-Project 1, a collaborative effort focused on the digitization of a rare 20th-century Ismaili publication from Gilgit-Baltistan.

This project, conducted under the guidance of the Aga Khan Library (London), aimed to ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of an important manuscript, Kitāb-i Tuḥfatah al-Nāẓirīn al-Maʿrūf Ṣaḥīfah bi-Inẓimām Sharḥ al-Marātib va Davāzdah Faṣl az Taḍyīfāt Sayyid Suhrāb Raḍavī al-Badakhshānī.

Through this work, we explored the full digitization workflow—from careful scanning and image cleaning to OCR transcription using eScriptorium and Python-based evaluation of model accuracy.
The project not only introduced us to key digital humanities tools but also reminded us of the continuing importance of human insight and collaboration in refining automated processes.
